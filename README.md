* 02443 - Stochastic Simulation
* 02477 - Bayesiansk Machine Learning
* 02582 - Computational Data Analysis
* 02612 - Constrained Optimisation
* 02686 - Scientific Computing for Differential Equations
* 02953 - Convex Optimization
* 42136 - Large Scale Optimization using Decomposition

Further I have also had the following special courses and projects:
* S01 Numerical Methods for SDEs and Levy Processes
* S01 Scientific Machine Learning
* Bachelor Thesis
* Master Thesis

The last two folders named 'S01 Deep Generative Models' and 'S01 Deep Implicit Layers' are collections of sources for learning more advanced topics within Deep Learning.
