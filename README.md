# DTU Compute Courses
This repository primarily contains all the courses I have taken at DTU during my Masters studies. The courses are:
* 01125 - Fundamental Topological Concepts and Metric Spaces
* 01617 - Introduction to Dynamical Systems
* 02407 - Stochastic Processes - Probability 2
* 02424 - Advanced Data Analysis and Statistical Modelling
* 02425 - Diffusions and Stochastic Differential Equations
* 02427 - Advanced Time Series Analysis
* 02443 - Stochastic Simulation
* 02477 - Bayesiansk Machine Learning
* 02582 - Computational Data Analysis
* 02612 - Constrained Optimisation
* 02686 - Scientific Computing for Differential Equations
* 02953 - Convex Optimization
* 42136 - Large Scale Optimization using Decomposition

Further I have also had the following special courses and projects:
* S01 Numerical Methods for SDEs and Levy Processes
* S01 Scientific Machine Learning
* Bachelor Thesis
* Master Thesis

The last two folders, named 'S01 Deep Generative Models' and 'S01 Deep Implicit Layers', are collections of sources for learning more advanced topics within Deep Learning.
